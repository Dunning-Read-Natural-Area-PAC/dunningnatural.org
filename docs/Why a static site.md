Why use a static site?
======================

The original https://dunningnatural.org was built as a Wordpress site by some excellent students at [Wright College](https://www.ccc.edu/colleges/wright/pages/default.aspx).

This site worked well for the PAC, and likely would have remained, were it not for hosting costs. Given the ongoing costs of hosting a Wordpress site & that we didn't need a lot of the features of a CMS, the Communications Committee made a call during the Mar 2024 meeting to move to a static website. There are some tradeoffs, of course.

The main pros of a static site for us is cost. There are many free options for hosting a static site (e.g. CloudFlare pages or Github pages). We also no longer need to manage a Wordpress instance, ensuring that credentials are secure, plugins are up to date, etc.

The main downside is that the site isn't easily updatable for non-technical folks. However, given the website has had the same content since it was created (with the exception of updated images of board members), the pros outweigh this downside.
